Readings are probably one of the most stressful aspects of a student's college life. As one of the primary assignments students receive to learn about a topic, they can be painfully long, but most importantly very badly formatted and hard to read in the first place.

This is even more of a challenge for students with dyslexia, as if reading well-formated text was not already hard enough. 
Retina is a software that makes college readings easier to handle and work with by utilizing OCR and tools proven and adapted to help dyslexics to read. The backend is built using Python with the Django Framework and hosted on a PostgreSQL remote database, and the frontend is rendered using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Javascript.

This is still a project under development, and I am doing my best to make the experience of using it as delightful and seamless as possible.
